# R sentiment analysis

This repository contains code of a learning project called: "R sentiment analysis".

It's purpose is to analyse customer satisfaction and sentiment of a given input.

## Idea

Sentiment Analysis is a project that involves analyzing customer satisfaction and sentiment using R programming. The project can be broken down into several steps. First, you need to collect data from various sources such as social media, customer feedback forms, and surveys. Next, you need to preprocess the data by cleaning it, removing irrelevant information, and transforming it into a format that can be analyzed. After that, you can use R programming to perform sentiment analysis on the data. This involves using natural language processing techniques to identify the sentiment of the text, such as whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. Finally, you can visualize the results using various tools provided by R, such as bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots. This project can help you understand how to use R for data analysis and visualization, as well as gain insights into customer sentiment and satisfaction.
